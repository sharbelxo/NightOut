This application grants back the Lebanese nightlife the worth it carries. With the current Lebanese economic crisis, this application will be able to give the option to the citizens to choose the most convenient event in a user-friendly manner. Customers can select through a filter of events’ characteristics the option they prefer when it comes to cost, age, and music genre..., and they will then be able to browse through the suggested events. Our application does not provide only that type of service, but also it also helps venues, Lebanese clubs and host areas, to share their events as a marketing tool to attract and welcome the interested audience. Venues will have their event requested, and a manager will be able to approve/decline the event. In that way, it is ensured that all events are credible. While buiding this application severalaspects were taken into consideration, such as data protection and optimization. Therefore, throughout this report elaboration will be provided on the database schema, frontend, and backend.
